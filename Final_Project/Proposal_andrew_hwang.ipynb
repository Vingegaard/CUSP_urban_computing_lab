    "Q1. Introduce your research question:\n",
    "  - Over the past decade, numerous new transportation and delivery services have emerged, making our lives\n",
    "  more convenient and faster. Key trends were bike-sharing services like Citi bike, e-scooter services like Lime, and delivery services\n",
    "  like Doordash, Grubhub.\n",
    "  While these services have increased convenience, they have also made NYC traffic more dangerous.\n",
    "  I aim to examine the impact of these new vehicles on NYC safety by analysing Motor Vehicle Collisions data."

    "  With rapid technological advancement, we expect more transportation and logistics sevices in the coming decades.\n",

    "  - The dataset includes the 'type' of vehicle, but this data is not clean. For example, to filter all the bikes, I need to search for various terms like bike, BIKE, EBIKE, E-bike, E Bike, motorbike, Motorbike, etc.\n",
    "  - Even after filtering for bikes and motorbikes, I still wouldn't know the purpose of the vehicle's use, such as personal or delivery use. It's not possible to distinguish them by the purposes but we can understand the overall trend of accidents involving bikes, motorcycle and e-scooters. "
